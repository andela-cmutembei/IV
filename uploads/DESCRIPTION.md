### Uploads directory

This is the directory to hold the user uploaded image files.

- A sub-directory is created for each logged-in user upload, to help avoid conflicts when reading the files as well as to achieve a fairly neat structure.
- For uploads when there is no logged-in user, the image files are stored in a sub-directory called [anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)
